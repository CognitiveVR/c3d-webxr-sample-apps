# ThreeJS WebXR PWA with Cognitive3D Analytics

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description 
This is a simple WebXR application built with Three.js, featuring a basic interactive VR scene. 
The project is also configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA).  

Most importantly, it integrates Cognitive3D WEBXR SDK (c3d-webxr-sdk) within a javascript/ threeJS/ PWA project. The SDK currently tracks session and gaze tracking with the application. Please view the browser console for details on the network calls. 
This application can be accessed within a VR browser so through a desktop browser (via Oculus Link)
